## 📊 Executive Summary & Model Selection

The primary objective of V1 was to minimize financial loss by maximizing **Recall** (capturing as many frauds as possible) while maintaining an operationally manageable False Positive Rate.

**Key metrics:** Recall captures real frauds (higher → fewer losses), Precision measures true alerts (higher → fewer false alarms), PR-AUC shows overall fraud separation ability. F1-Score, ROC-AUC, and Accuracy are not used in production.

### The Challenge: Extreme Imbalance

The dataset presents a severe imbalance (0.17% Fraud vs 99.83% Legitimate), requiring specialized techniques like `scale_pos_weight` in XGBoost rather than standard accuracy metrics.

![Fig 1. The 598:1 ratio makes standard accuracy a misleading metric](https://github.com/renteria-luis/fraud-detection-v1/raw/main/assets/figures/class_distribution.png)

### Model Benchmarking

Three architectures were evaluated during the experimentation phase. **XGBoost** was selected as the production model due to its superior handling of class imbalance via `scale_pos_weight` and inference speed.

| **Model**               | **Recall** | **Precision** | **PR-AUC** | **Verdict**                                  |
|-------------------------|------------|---------------|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Logistic Regression      | 0.71       | 0.70          | 0.74       | Baseline. Many false positives              |
| Random Forest            | **0.86**   | 0.77          | 0.87       | High precision, missed crucial fraud        |
| XGBoost (Tuned)          | **0.87**   | 0.82          | **0.88**   | **Selected.** Best Recall/Precision balance|


### Production Performance (V1)

- **Operational Threshold:** `0.2072` (Optimized for F2-Score/Recall).
- **Business Impact:** The model captures **87%** of fraudulent transactions.
- **Latency:** ~10ms per transaction via FastAPI.

## 🔎 Key Data Insights (EDA)

Before modeling, an extensive exploratory analysis revealed critical patterns used for feature selection.

1. Feature Separation:
Variables V14, V10, and V12 showed the strongest discriminative power. As seen below, V14 provides a clear (though not perfect) separation boundary between classes compared to other features.

![Fig 2. Scatter plot showing V14 vs Top 3 correlated features. Fraud points are distinct outliers](https://github.com/renteria-luis/fraud-detection-v1/raw/main/assets/figures/scatter_v14_vs_top3.png)

---
## ⚙️ Feature Engineering Strategy

Raw data is never enough. The `src/features` module implements custom Scikit-learn transformers to extract signal from noise:

1. **Temporal Cyclical Encoding**
EDA revealed a distinct pattern: Fraudulent activity remains consistent during the night, while legitimate transactions drop drastically. However, For this version, V1…V28 remain untouched to preserve their principal component properties.

![Fig 3. Density plot showing the "Night Valley" where legitimate traffic drops, but fraud persists](https://github.com/renteria-luis/fraud-detection-v1/raw/main/assets/figures/time_distribution.png)

Based on this, we engineered:

  - **Cyclical Encoding:** Converted `Time` to Sine/Cosine components $(sin(2πt/24))$ to preserve 24h continuity.
  - **Is Night Flag:** Binary feature for transactions between 22:00–06:00.
    
2. **Amount Scaling**
  - **Log Transformation:** Applied $\log(1 + x)$ to `Amount` to handle extreme right-skewness.
  - **Micro/Macro Flags:** Binary features for very small $(<\$1)$ or large $(>95th percentile)$ transactions.

## 📁 Project Architecture

This repository follows strict **MLOps principles**. Code is modularized into a source package (`src`) rather than living in notebooks.

> **Note on Language Stats:** You might notice GitHub reports this repo as ~94% Python. Jupyter Notebooks are explicitly marked as documentation in `.gitattributes` to reflect the engineering effort put into the `.py` source code.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A: Docker (Recommended)

Run the entire system (API + Environment) without installing Python locally.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/renteria-luis/fraud-detection-v1.git
cd fraud-detection-v1

# 2. Build and Run
docker compose up --build
```

- **API Health Check:** `http://localhost:8000/health`
- **Interactive Docs (Swagger):** `http://localhost:8000/docs`
  

### Option B: Local Development

To run locally with **hot-reloading** enabled (changes in `src/` reflect immediately):

```bash
# Uses docker-compose.override.yml automatically
docker compose up
```
