## 📊 Executive Summary

The primary objective of V1 was to maximize **Recall** — capturing as many fraudulent transactions as possible — while maintaining an operationally manageable false positive rate.

**Key metrics:** Recall captures real frauds (higher → fewer losses). Precision measures alert quality (higher → fewer false alarms). PR-AUC measures overall fraud separation ability. Accuracy is discarded due to the 349:1 class imbalance.

### The Challenge: Extreme Imbalance

The dataset presents a severe imbalance — only 0.29% of transactions after filtering are fraudulent. Standard accuracy would reach 99.7% by predicting everything as legitimate, which is useless for fraud detection.

![Fig 1. The 349:1 ratio makes standard accuracy a misleading metric](https://github.com/renteria-luis/fraud-detection-v1/raw/main/assets/figures/class_distribution.png)

### Model Benchmarking (threshold = 0.2226 for all)

| Model | Precision | Recall | F1 | PR-AUC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | 0.65 | 0.40 | 0.50 | 0.48 |
| Random Forest | 0.76 | 0.78 | 0.77 | 0.81 |
| **XGBoost (Default)** | **0.84** | **0.85** | **0.84** | **0.91** |
| XGBoost (Tuned) | 0.24 | 0.98 | 0.39 | 0.92 |

> XGBoost Tuned achieved the highest PR-AUC (0.92) but produced a distorted precision curve at low thresholds, making threshold selection unreliable. XGBoost Default was selected for its cleaner and more stable behavior.

### Production Performance (V1)

| Threshold | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.5 (default) | 0.93 | 0.79 | 0.85 |
| **0.2226 (operational)** | **0.84** | **0.85** | **0.84** |

- **PR-AUC:** `0.9079`
- **ROC-AUC:** `0.9285`
- **Operational Threshold:** `0.2226` — lowered from 0.5 to recover the 6% of fraud missed at default. In fraud detection, a missed fraud costs more than a false alarm.

## 🔎 Key Data Insights (EDA)

**1. Fraud is type-specific.** Fraudulent activity occurs exclusively in `TRANSFER` (0.77% fraud rate) and `CASH_OUT` (0.18%) transactions. `PAYMENT`, `CASH_IN`, and `DEBIT` have zero fraud — they were removed from the dataset entirely to eliminate noise.

**2. Fraud is time-agnostic (bot behavior).** Legitimate transactions follow a human circadian cycle — clear peaks during business hours and a sharp drop at night. Fraud is flat and constant across all hours, consistent with automated bot activity. Transactions between 00:00–06:00 are disproportionately risky.

![Fig 3. Fraud is flat across all hours while legitimate traffic follows a circadian cycle](https://github.com/renteria-luis/fraud-detection-v1/raw/main/assets/figures/time_distribution.png)

**3. A simulation artifact was corrected.** Legitimate transactions drop sharply after day 17 of the simulation while fraud continues through day 30 — an artifact of the synthetic data generator. The dataset was truncated at the last step where legitimate traffic exists to prevent the model from learning a false "late-month = fraud" pattern.

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

Raw columns are never fed directly to the model. The `src/features/engineering.py` module implements a custom `PaySimFeatures` sklearn transformer that fits on training data and transforms both splits cleanly.

**Behavioral aggregates** (fitted on train, applied to test):
- `dest_tx_count` — how many transactions has this destination received? Mule accounts accumulate many.
- `dest_unique_orig` — how many different senders? Mules receive from multiple sources.

**Transaction signals:**
- `is_transfer`, `is_cash_out` — type encoded as binary flags.
- `log_amount` — log-transformed amount to reduce right-skewness.
- `is_large_tx` — binary flag for amounts above the 95th percentile.
- `is_round_amount` — round amounts (mod 1000 = 0) are a weak but consistent signal.

**Temporal signals:**
- `hour_of_day` — derived from simulation step (step % 24).
- `is_night` — binary flag for hours 00–06.

**Balance signals** (intentional leakage — documented in notebook):
- `dest_was_empty` — destination account had $0 before receiving funds. Strong mule account signal.
- `log_dest_balance`, `amount_to_dest_ratio` — context around destination balance.
- `log_orig_balance` — origin account balance before transaction. Technically available pre-transaction, but artificially predictive in PaySim due to synthetic data patterns.

## 📅 Roadmap

| Feature | V1 (Current) | V2 (Planned) |
|---|---|---|
| Dataset | PaySim (Synthetic) | Real transaction data |
| Algorithm | XGBoost (Default) | TBD — DL if dataset justifies it |
| Validation | Stratified random split | Out-of-time split |
| Explainability | Feature Importance | SHAP |
| Features | Static behavioral aggregates | Temporal velocity features |

V2 is contingent on finding a dataset with real transaction data. Further iteration on PaySim carries diminishing returns given its synthetic nature and single fraud pattern.
